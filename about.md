## About

So why a fund-raiser page? The main driver is to ensure the continuity of Swing Picnics for the Year 2019 (and future years, if this idea proves to be feasible).

As how I understood it, the costs of running a Swing Picnic isn't affordable, and has been on an increase over the years.

While the Office of Public Works (OPW) is kind enough to offer us the venue for musical and artistic events, we still need to fork out a sum of money, both to pay IMRO for a broadcast license, and to be insured for liability.

A long time back ago (as the old-timers told me), the OPW used to waive the IMRO license, but we're now required to pay for it. And for the liability insurance, it's usually covered by riding on the professional liability insurance that the dancer instructor has.

In the past years since Rory's been running this, he has forked off both costs out of his own pocket.

This is neither equitable, nor a sustainable way of trying the Swing Picnic going.

Which is why I've set up this page.
